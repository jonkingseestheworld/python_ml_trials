# Some Python Machine Learning attempts

## 1. Azure ML Studio
A cloud-based platform that allows you to train, deploy, automate, manage, and track ML models (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-ml). 
In this attempt, an Azure ML web service is deployed directly from within the Jupyter notebook (can also be done in other Python environment) using the azureml package.
