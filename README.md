# Some Python-based Machine Learning attempts

## 1. Using Azure ML Studio (an attempt on diabetes prediction)
Azure ML Studio, an Microsoft cloud-based platform ([to read more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-ml)) that allows you to train, deploy, automate, manage, and track ML models. 
In this attempt, an Azure ML web service is deployed directly from within the Jupyter notebook (can also be done in other Python environment) using the `azureml` package.

> Another way is to develop the models directly on [Microsoft Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net) (or Microsoft Azure Machine Learning sService, which provides end-to-end lifecycle management for ML models).


#### The reasons to use a cloud-based platform
(Perhaps apart from the biggest advantage of giving organisiations/individuals the access to high-performance infrastructure that they might not be able to afford on their own,) sometimes you simply want your models to be accessible from a number of locations. (e.g. accessible from the web)


### Core dependencies
**[Python 2](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)** 
> Note: It seems that earlier versions of the `azureml` package (which was installed to run the current notebook) works only with Python 2. (Yet, the more updated versions of [`azureml`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-MachineLearning-ClientLibrary-Python) seem to be compatible with Python 3 now.) 

| Package                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| [azureml](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Azure-MachineLearning-ClientLibrary-Python) |
| [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)                 |
| [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)     |
| [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)                 |

You also need access to an Azure ML Studio workspace ([Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net) is free and does not require an Azure subscription. You can sign in with an Microsoft account.) There are step-by-step procedures in the jupyter notebook you can follow to get connected to an Azure ML Studio workspace.
